# Uber-POOL-project-analysis

**Overview**
Uber, founded in 2009 as a luxury car service, rapidly grew with the introduction of UberX in 2012, offering more affordable rides. By 2018, Uber had expanded globally with 75 million riders and a valuation of $62 billion, despite competition from other ride-sharing platforms. Data science played a pivotal role in its innovation, while the launch of UberPOOL in 2014 faced challenges, becoming unprofitable by 2016 due to unmatched rides.

**Objective**- to Understand How could Uber improve the POOL experience?
